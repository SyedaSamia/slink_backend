## Capabilities

A user can enter an arbitrary URL "X" on the website and get a shortened URL in return.

On visiting the shortened URL, the user gets redirected to â€œX".

The shortening has to be idempotent, i.e. a given URL always has to yield the same short URL as a result.

On the website, the user can also see stats for all shortUrls that have been generated (by anyone) on the site:
  For each shortUrl, how often did someone attempt to shorten that specific URL?
  For each shortUrl, how often was it visited?
